Instructions for the Avatar Creator Demo</h1>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Brief
Description of Functionality</span>:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The IMI avatar creator demo was designed to quickly generate xml
configuration files for avatars. &nbsp;Future changes and upgrades will
better make use of the tool as a device for artists to test their
assets before submission. &nbsp;The tool allows for the following:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Load random configurations of avatars</li>
    <li>Modify the avatar (joint manipulation, mesh swaping, texture
swaping).</li>
    <li>Saving configurations</li>
    <li>Loading previously saved configurations</li>
    <li>View how the differnt meshes fit with the other meshes (ie
determine if a head fits onto a shirt w/o tearing)</li>
    <li>Manipulate the individual nodes that comprise of the avatar</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3><br>
</h3>
<h3>Loading
An Avatar:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The viewer is designed to randomly create an avatar configuration
based on the gender specified</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Loading instructions:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Press either the random male avatar button (second button from
the top right bar) or the random female avatar button (right most
button on the top bar)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Known Issues</span>:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>When you randomly create an avatar it loads the random
selection of files from our webserver. &nbsp;This can be a bit
slow.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Unfortunately there is an issue with the random creation and
the progress bar (ie the progress bar doesn't update)... It does
however work for all the other loadings.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3>Swapping Meshes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The meshes that the user can swap out / in on the avatar are
seperated into the following catagories:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Head - The avatar head</li>
    <li>UpperBody - The torso and arms of the avatar (this means shirts
and stuff)</li>
    <li>LowerBody - The waist and legs of the avatar (this means pants
and shorts stuff)</li>
    <li>Feet - The ankle/feet of the avatar (this means shoes and
sandles)</li>
    <li>Hair - The head hair of the avatar (basically just hair)</li>
    <li>Jacket - Adds onto the UpperBody and doesn't remove what is
already on the UpperBody (this means jackets and coats)</li>
    <li>Glasses - Adds onto the the face of the avatar</li>
    <li>Hat - Adds ontop of the head of the avatar</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Loading instructions:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>File -&gt; Load Model</li>
    <li>Choose what catagory of model you want to load:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Avatar - select a folder which contains all the assets which
make up an avatar **DO NOT USE THIS FOR NOW**</li>
      <li>Head - select the collada (*.dae) or binary file (*.bhf) of a
head to load onto an avatar.&nbsp;</li>
      <ul>
        <li>selecting this option will ask the user to select if the
head is normal mapped or not. &nbsp;This selection determines the
correct shader the system will use.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Clothes - select the collada (*.dae) file of the clothes you
want to load. (includes shirts, pants, shoes, &amp; jackets)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>selecting this option will ask the user to select which
subgroup the article of clothing will go into:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>UpperBody</li>
          <li>LowerBody</li>
          <li>Feet</li>
          <li>Jacket</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Accesories - select the collada (*.dae) file of the accessory
you want to load. (includes hats, glasses, &amp; hair)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>selecting this option will ask the user for the subgroup
the accessory will go into:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Hair</li>
          <li>Hat</li>
          <li>Glasses</li>
        </ul>
        <li>after subgroup selection, the user must select the joint to
add it onto</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Head</li>
          <li>Neck</li>
        </ul>
        <li>after selecting the joint, the user must input the name of
the geometry to add (the name of the mesh in the file ie mt_spikeyHair)</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>When the progress bar stops (is gray) and Loading... is no
longer visible in the status bar, the screen will update with the
changes.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

  <li><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Known Issues</span>:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>There is no undo so be sure of what you are doing...</li>

<h3>Swapping Textures &amp; Shaders:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The user can change the textures on the meshes as well as the
shader being used on that piece of geometry. &nbsp;The tool allows the
user to create a new texture for a selected mesh or replace the
existing texture with one that has already been created. &nbsp;The user
can also create a shader to be used on that mesh or load an existing
shader template and manipulate the values.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Loading instructions:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Tools -&gt; Texture Editor</li>
    <li>TO BE CONTINUED...</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Changeing Colors:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The user can change the color mask on the meshes. &nbsp;The tool
allows the user to change the color mask on the mesh based on the the
type (ie shirt, pants, shoes, skinetone, etc...). &nbsp;The user
toggles the button for the category (more than one can be toggled if
they user wants them to be the same color), and then color change is
done by selecting color swatches or moving the marker on the color
gradient (HUE, SATURATION, etc).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Loading instructions:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Tools -&gt; Color Selector</li>
    <li>Toggle the category of meshes to affect</li>
    <li>Choose the color to apply. &nbsp;As soon as the color is
selected, the user can see the effect on the avatar in the window.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Known Issues</span>:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Sometimes there are visual artifacts when the color changes,
but when the color change is complete it is back to normal.</li>
